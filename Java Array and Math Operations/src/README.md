# Java Array and Math Operations

This Java program demonstrates various array operations and mathematical functions.

## Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. In this program, we explore different operations on arrays:

- Printing an array using `Arrays.toString()`
- Sorting an array using `Arrays.sort()`
- Getting the length of an array using the `length` property
- Creating and initializing arrays
- Accessing and modifying elements of multi-dimensional arrays

## Math Operations

Java's `Math` class provides methods for performing mathematical operations. Here are some examples used in this program:

- `Math.max()`: Returns the maximum of two numbers.
- `Math.random()`: Generates a random double value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).
- Generating random numbers within a specific range using `Math.random()`.
- Generating random whole numbers using `Math.random()` and typecasting.
