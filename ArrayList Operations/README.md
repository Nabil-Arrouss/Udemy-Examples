# ArrayList Operations

This Java program demonstrates basic operations with ArrayList, including adding elements, printing the elements, and removing elements randomly.

## Main Class

The `Main` class contains the `main` method, which demonstrates the following operations:

1. Creating an ArrayList of type String.
2. Adding elements to the ArrayList.
3. Printing the elements of the ArrayList.
4. Calling a method to remove elements randomly and print the left element.

## printLeftElement Method

The `printLeftElement` method removes elements randomly from the ArrayList until only one element remains. It then returns the left element.
