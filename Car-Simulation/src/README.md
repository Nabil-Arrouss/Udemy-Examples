# Car Simulation Program

This Java program simulates different types of cars and their functionalities using object-oriented programming concepts.

## Overview

The program includes the following classes:

- `Main`: The main class where the simulation of different car types takes place. It creates instances of various car classes and invokes their methods to demonstrate their functionalities.

- `Car`: The base class representing a generic car. It contains attributes such as engine status, number of cylinders, name, and number of wheels. Additionally, it includes methods for starting the engine, accelerating, and braking.

- `Mitsubishi`, `Mercedes`, `Ford`: Subclasses representing specific car brands. Each subclass inherits attributes and methods from the `Car` class and provides specific implementations for starting the engine, accelerating, and braking.

## Functionality

- Users can create instances of different car types (Mitsubishi, Mercedes, Ford) and invoke their methods to observe their behaviors.

- Each car type has its own unique behavior when the engine is started, accelerated, or braked, providing an immersive experience for the user.
